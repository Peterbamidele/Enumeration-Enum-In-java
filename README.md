# Enumeration-Enum-In-java

Enums in Java can be thought of as classes with a set of constants. Java enum constants are implicitly static and final. Since JDK 1.5, it has been available.

We use enums to generate our own data types, similar to classes. In Java, an enum is defined using the enum data type (also known as Enumerated Data Type). In Java, enum is more influential. We may define an enum either within or outside the function.
